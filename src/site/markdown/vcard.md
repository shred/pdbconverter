# VCard

*Note*: Unfortunately, more recent PalmOS devices store some parts of the address book in an invisible second database. For this reason, the export lacks a few parts of the address book, like photos and birthdays.

Also note that the vCard format is not able to represent the address database accurately, since it's difficult to evaluate the PalmOS' address database programmatically. The resulting vCard file may be rather unusable or even invalid. If you want to convert your address book for post-processing with other tools, I suggest to use the XML output format, which is more accurate.
